== Description ==

WWT Creator is a dynamic [WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/) tour creator that allows educators/bloggers/podcasters to create WWT tours on the fly. It's feature rich and includes all you need to get an awesome tour up and running with custom objects and the ability to add your own music or narration. Show off the universe in your own way, visiting cool galactic destinations and adding a [sweet soundtrack](http://www.ilovem83.com/) to the adventure.
